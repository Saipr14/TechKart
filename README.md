#Techkart ,my first E-Commerce website.

#First of all i want to metion which components will not work here:
    i)The sign-in and sign-up forms are under work will be given a bit of php and connected to the MySql server.
    ii)Secondly the shop-by-category is the first place(page)that will be developed in near future.
    iii)At third, i want to do some researches to decide the low-end and high-end specs categories .So keep looking for it.:):)

#if you see anything i can upgrade here ,please write me ;)

#You may think of AddToCart feature ,once products are added it will be added soon.

#Some of that will be done within 31st august.Just setting myself a target.
